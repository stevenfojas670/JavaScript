# **JavaScript Project Based Learning**

Welcome to my JavaScript PBL repository. I will be working on my JavaScript skills through Project Based Learning.

Here is what I have planned to create so far:

1. **Weather App**
2. **Personal Website**
3. **Basic Stock App**

**Weather App**

- Runs with node.js on localhost:3000
- Start with: node server.js

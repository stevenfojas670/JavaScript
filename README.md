# **JavaScript Project Based Learning**

Welcome to my JavaScript PBL repository. I will be working on my JavaScript skills through Project Based Learning.

Here is what I have planned to create so far:

1. **Weather App**
2. **Personal Website**
3. **Basic Stock App**

# **Weather App**

## Instructions
- To run `nodemon server.js`
- To use the WeatherAPI, create an account at (weatherapi.com) and copy and paste your key into a .env file. Title your key WEATHERAPI_KEY.

## Implementation
- Uses (weatherapi.com API)
- Uses express.js for future scalability and more flexibility.
- Uses nodemon for hot-reloading.
- Uses routes to a weather controller to make the weather API requests.
- Uses morgan for logging weatherAPI requests and API requests to the backend (Implemented by ChatGPT).
